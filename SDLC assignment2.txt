ASSIGNMENT 2:

Case Study: Implementing SDLC Phases in the Development of an E-Commerce Platform
Project Overview
This case study examines the implementation of SDLC phases in the development of an e-commerce platform for a mid-sized retail company, ShopEZ. The project aimed to create a comprehensive online shopping experience, including features like product listings, user accounts, shopping carts, payment processing, and order tracking.
SDLC Phases Analysis

1. Requirement Gathering
Activities:
•	Conducted stakeholder interviews with company executives, marketing team, and potential users.
•	Documented functional requirements (e.g., product search, secure payment gateway) and non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security).
•	Created use cases and user stories to capture detailed scenarios of platform usage.
Outcome:
•	Developed a detailed Requirements Specification Document that served as the foundation for subsequent phases.
•	Identified critical features and prioritized them, ensuring that essential functionalities were addressed first.
Contribution to Project Outcomes:
•	Provided a clear understanding of project goals and user expectations.
•	Minimized scope creep by establishing well-defined requirements.

2. Design
Activities:
•	Designed the system architecture, including database schema, server infrastructure, and third-party integrations (e.g., payment gateways).
•	Created wireframes and mockups for the user interface, emphasizing usability and aesthetics.
•	Developed detailed design documents, including UML diagrams and data flow diagrams.
Outcome:
•	Produced a Design Specification Document that outlined the technical blueprint for the platform.
•	Ensured alignment between stakeholders and the development team on the project’s technical approach.
Contribution to Project Outcomes:
•	Facilitated a structured approach to development, reducing the risk of miscommunication and errors.
•	Enabled early identification of potential technical challenges, allowing for proactive mitigation.

3. Implementation
Activities:
•	Developed the platform using an iterative approach, focusing on modularity and code reusability.
•	Implemented core functionalities such as user authentication, product management, and shopping cart.
•	Conducted regular code reviews and pair programming sessions to ensure code quality.
Outcome:
•	Created a robust and scalable codebase.
•	Maintained consistent progress through sprints, delivering incremental updates for stakeholder review.
Contribution to Project Outcomes:
•	Accelerated development by using agile methodologies, allowing for flexibility and rapid adaptation to changes.
•	Ensured high code quality through continuous integration and regular testing.

4. Testing
Activities:
•	Performed unit testing on individual modules to verify their functionality.
•	Conducted integration testing to ensure seamless interaction between different components.
•	Executed system testing and user acceptance testing (UAT) to validate the platform against requirements.
Outcome:
•	Identified and resolved critical bugs and performance issues before deployment.
•	Gathered feedback from stakeholders during UAT, leading to minor adjustments and improvements.
Contribution to Project Outcomes:
•	Ensured the platform was reliable and met user expectations.
•	Reduced the likelihood of post-deployment issues, enhancing user satisfaction.

5. Deployment
Activities:
•	Prepared the production environment, including server configuration and database setup.
•	Deployed the platform using a staged approach, starting with a beta release for select users.
•	Conducted post-deployment monitoring to identify and resolve any emerging issues.
Outcome:
•	Successfully launched the e-commerce platform to the public.
•	Provided ongoing support to address user feedback and optimize performance.
Contribution to Project Outcomes:
•	Achieved a smooth transition from development to production, minimizing downtime and disruptions.
•	Enabled immediate user access, facilitating business operations and revenue generation.

6. Maintenance
Activities:
•	Established a maintenance plan for regular updates, bug fixes, and security patches.
•	Monitored platform performance and user feedback to identify areas for improvement.
•	Implemented new features based on evolving business needs and user requests.
Outcome:
•	Maintained platform stability and security over time.
•	Enhanced user experience by continuously improving and expanding functionalities.
Contribution to Project Outcomes:
•	Ensured long-term sustainability and relevance of the platform.
•	Fostered user loyalty and trust through consistent performance and feature enhancements.
