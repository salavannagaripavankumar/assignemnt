The SDAP layer provides the following services to upper layers:

QoS Flow Management: SDAP manages the Quality of Service (QoS) flows, including flow establishment, modification, and release.
Data Transfer: SDAP provides data transfer services, including data transmission and reception, to upper layers.
Mapping QoS Flow to DRB: SDAP maps QoS flows to Data Radio Bearers (DRBs), which are used to transport data between the UE and the network.
Services expected from lower layers:

The SDAP layer expects the following services from lower layers:

Data Transport: SDAP expects the lower layers (e.g., PDCP, RLC, MAC) to provide reliable data transport services.
QoS Support: SDAP expects the lower layers to provide QoS support, including prioritization and scheduling of data packets.
Main functions of the SDAP layer:

The main functions of the SDAP layer include:

QoS Flow Management: managing QoS flows, including flow establishment, modification, and release.
Data Transfer: providing data transfer services, including data transmission and reception.
Mapping QoS Flow to DRB: mapping QoS flows to DRBs.
SDAP Entity Management: managing SDAP entities, including establishment and release.
Now, let's outline the main points for each test case:

Test Case 1: Establishing an SDAP Entity
** Preconditions**: The UE is connected to the network, and the SDAP layer is configured.
Steps:
The UE sends an SDAP entity establishment request to the network.
The network responds with an SDAP entity establishment response.
The SDAP entity is established, and the UE and network can exchange data.
Expected Result: The SDAP entity is successfully established.
Test Case 2: Releasing an SDAP Entity
** Preconditions**: An SDAP entity is established between the UE and the network.
Steps:
The UE sends an SDAP entity release request to the network.
The network responds with an SDAP entity release response.
The SDAP entity is released, and the UE and network can no longer exchange data.
Expected Result: The SDAP entity is successfully released.
Test Case 3: Data Transfer in Downlink
** Preconditions**: An SDAP entity is established between the UE and the network.
Steps:
The network sends data to the UE via the SDAP layer.
The SDAP layer maps the QoS flow to a DRB.
The data is transmitted to the UE via the DRB.
Expected Result: The data is successfully transmitted to the UE.
Test Case 4: Data Transfer in Uplink
** Preconditions**: An SDAP entity is established between the UE and the network.
Steps:
The UE sends data to the network via the SDAP layer.
The SDAP layer maps the QoS flow to a DRB.
The data is transmitted to the network via the DRB.
Expected Result: The data is successfully transmitted to the network.
Mapping QoS Flow to DRB
** Preconditions**: An SDAP entity is established between the UE and the network.
Steps:
The SDAP layer receives a QoS flow establishment request from the upper layers.
The SDAP layer maps the QoS flow to a DRB based on the QoS requirements.
The DRB is established, and the QoS flow is transmitted via the DRB.
Expected Result: The QoS flow is successfully mapped to a DRB
